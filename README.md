# High-Level-Synthesis
Highly Configurable Massive MIMO Detector Design using High-Level Synthesis

* The detection algorithm has been programmed in C-code. A netlist (VHDL/Verilog/SystemC) has been generated by synthesizing the C-code using High-Level Synthesis in the Vivado HLS.
* A testbench in C-code has been built to provide MIMO uplink received data.
* The testbench has been expanded with the C model of the massive MIMO detector based on the Gauss-Seidel binary tree structure. It has also been made self-checking. It checks if the output of the software model and the synthesized C-code are identical.
* The design has been optimized to reduce the latency using arbitrary precision fixed-point data types and HLS directives. It can easily be configured in the number of antennas, the number of users, and the cluster size.
