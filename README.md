# High-Level-Synthesis
Highly Configurable Massive MIMO Detector Design using High-Level Synthesis

* The detection algorithm has been programmed in C-code. A netlist (VHDL/Verilog/SystemC) has been generated by synthesizing the C-code using High-Level Synthesis in the Vivado HLS suite.
* A testbench in C-code has been built to provide MIMO uplink received data.
* The testbench has been expanded with the C model of the massive MIMO detector based on the Gauss-Seidel binary tree structure. It has also been made self-checking. It checks if the output of the software model and the synthesized C-code are identical.
* The design has been optimized to reduce the latency using different HLS directives and arbitrary precision fixed-point data types. The systolic array architectures have beenappiled for parallel operation. The design can easily be configured in the number of antennas, the number of users, and the cluster size.
